MD5sums-java
============

This project tries to be a clone of the md5sums application for unix systems. I created this project, because I needed to compare a lot of binary files without the help of an utility.

Run the compiled and JARed program with `java -jar md5sum.jar "C:\Path\To\Folder"`
